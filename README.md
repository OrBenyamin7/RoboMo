# RoboMo - An Integrated Internet of Things Monitoring System – Joint work with TAMK University
## Project code: 24-2-D-11


This repository contains the **project documentation, and presentation** materials for the Integrated IoT System developed in collaboration with TAMK University. The system is designed to monitor and transmit live data from robotics and sensors, providing a platform for real-time data management and analysis.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create an **IoT platform** that allows users to upload, monitor, and analyze data from various robotics and sensor systems. It serves as a proof of concept for a scalable Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solution, which can be used in both academic and industrial environments. This project is the result of collaboration between TAMK University and Braude, marking the first Industry 4.0 initiative at Braude.

## Phase A Directory
